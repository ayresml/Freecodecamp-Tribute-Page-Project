    <h2>History of the Chinese Crested</h2>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Although hairless dogs have been found in many places in the world, it is unlikely that the origins of the modern Chinese crested are in China. 
      </li>
      <li>The Chinese Crested Dog is believed to have originated from the African hairless dog breed.
      </li>
      <li>
      It was discovered by Chinese sailors and merchants traveling to African ports on their routes who immediately saw the advantages of a small hairless dog which is largely unaffected by fleas. 
      </li>  
      <li>
      The Crested is believed to have accompanied Chinese sailors on the high seas as early as 1530, hunting vermin during and between times of plague. 
      </li>
      <li>
        It wasnâ€™t until the 1700s, when European travellers and explores visited seaports in various parts of Africa and Asia and boarded Chinese trading vessels that awareness of Chinese Cresteds began to increase. 
      </li>
      <li>
        During the 1850s and 1860s, several Cresteds were shown at an exhibition in England, and photographs of them were circulated. In the United States Three Chinese Cresteds were shown in 1878 at the Gilmore Garden show (predecessor to Madison Square Garden) and Two Chinese Cresteds were first exhibited in 1885 at the Westminster Kennel Club Show in New York.
